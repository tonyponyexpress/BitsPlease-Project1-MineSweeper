def main():
	"""
	The __main__ class utilizes a finite state machine structure to manage the overall flow
	of the game from start up to game ending.

	**States**
		There are five states that the game undergoes. The states and their interactions summarized:

		*Start*: The default state when the game is first run. This state creates the StartScreen, which
		asks players what board size they perfer and the number of mines on the board. This state will end
		either when the player quits the game with a state *Exit* or generates a game with a state *Minesweeper*.

		*Minesweeper*: This state runs when the player is actually playing minesweeper. This state monitors how the game
		is progressing. Once the player wins or loses, this state will record the outcome then change state.
		There are only two ways to change state - when the game is won or lost with a state *End* or when the player quits
		the game with a state *Exit*.

		*End*: This state throws up the appropirate end screen depending on whether or not the player won or lost. Then,
		awaits whether or not the player quits the game with a state *Exit* or starts a new game with state *Start*.

		*Exit*: This state exits out of the finite state machine and terminates the application.

		*CheatMode*: This state runs when the player enters cheat mode. This state shows the location of the mines and the
		number of the spaces with adjacent mines. When the user exits cheat mode it goes back to Minesweeper state
